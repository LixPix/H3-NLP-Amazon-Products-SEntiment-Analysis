She's not terribly food-motivated in general, but she adores this toy, and we've taken to giving her one of her 2 daily meals out of the 'food bomb.' She seems to love working to get all the food bits out of it, and when that's done she alternates between gnawing on the screw top end of the toy, chewing on the rubber bit, and whipping it around by the rope.<br /><br />That brings me to the only potential drawback of the food bomb--I am convinced one of these days she's going to give me a concussion if she loses her grip on the rope while she's flinging it about. But since she has those strong pit bull jaws, hopefully that won't be an issue... Sometimes I'm shocked she hasn't given *herself* a concussion with it, but her head is apparently made of concrete.<br /><br />(Oh--and it has withstood a year's worth of her efforts to destroy it so far, which is more than I can say for the vast majority of toys that enter the house.)",gAAAAABoh1-9QyqAMkEnrwz6un4QouVJyRC7vADMa99UX0pFyg1-Yf3VuE1NMM6gJvg5iBFC6ayjaJm_E4DLhXX81SBpCD-aMA==,Katharine Evans,really one best purchases weve ever made 3yearold pit bull aside giant orthopedic dog bed loves like candylike many pits clever eager work means needs lot mental stimulation order good citizen around house shes terribly foodmotivated general adores toy weve taken giving one 2 daily meals food bomb seems love working get food bits thats done alternates gnawing screw top end toy chewing rubber bit whipping around ropethat brings potential drawback food bombi convinced one days shes going give concussion loses grip rope shes flinging since strong pit bull jaws hopefully wont issue sometimes im shocked hasnt given concussion head apparently made concreteohand withstood years worth efforts destroy far say vast majority toys enter house,positive,2011-11

We no longer give him meals in a bowl, but either in this toy or in a Buster Cube. We prefer this to the Buster Cube when we are watching TV because it is less noisy. The Tug-a-Jug is solidly constructed.  We've had ours for a month so far, and have used it nearly every day.  It is absolutely worth the twelve dollars it is currently selling for.<br /><br />The medium/large size hard plastic bottle is about the size of a large (32 oz) sports drink bottle.  As the dog tugs the rope and manipulates the bottle, bits of kibble - or whatever you want to put in it - come out.  You can also change the level of challenge by putting ping pong balls or other things in the bottle.<br /><br />Hobbes is a 60 lb Lab mix, and a cup of kibble will last him about fifteen minutes.  In a bowl, the same amount is gone in seconds.  It's a great way for him to have some mental stimulation and settle down in the evening before bed.  Because he loves it so much, it's a great training aid.  At a minimum, he sits politely to ask for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: (September 2, 2011) Hobbes chewed right through the rope a month or so ago. However, we removed the remnants of the rope and put in more ping pong balls to plug the hole.

I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.

It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for ""aggressive chewers"" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats.

I'm now using and old medium width leash that I cut and knotted up on both ends (small enough to still let the treats out but not to have him spill all at once), which will also be easier to wash since I don't have to worry about fraying.

The replacement ended up being the same diameter, so I gave up on the rope altogether.  The way I adjust the difficulty of the ""game"" is by varying the size of the treats inserted.<br /><br />My dog doesn't eat kibble so I put in all natural treats, nuts, dehydrated salmon, etc. I sometimes throw in a whole walnut just to make the game harder.  He LOVES the toy and rolls it all over my apartment in an attempt to get everything out.<br /><br />When only the large, impossible-to-get pieces are left, my dog brings it to me out of frustration, and I reward him by opening the bottom and giving him the last pieces.<br /><br />One aspect of this toy that I really like is the fact that you can disassemble and wash it.  Some other toys say they're dishwasher safe but can't be opened, so I can't imagine the cleaning being very thorough.  Also, the ""mouth"" is made of soft rubber that [I would think] massages the dogs' gums and cleans their teeth a little.<br /><br />Overall this is a great, challenging, tiring game that rewards dogs for their effort and determination.

We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out.

After a few happy mistakes with pawing at it and watching us pull the rope, she caught on.

But, then again the bottom has never fallen off and the dog can't figure out how to unscrew the bottom.<br /><br />We had tried other 'treat balls' in the past, but found that they couldn't hold enough kibble to keep the activity going for very long. Other treat ball products were either to big or small for our dog's kibble, making getting the food out either way too easy (it fell right out) or too hard (it took a human with thumbs to get it out). Finally, the other treat balls were a solid rubber which meant in order to know if anything was left you had to pick it up and shake it.

We kept it out, though, and when he finally figured out his own system of getting dog food out of the jug, he was hooked!  Then we started putting all his meals in the jug instead of in his bowl.  Since starting his meals in the jug, Moby has an outlet for his curious energy and he spends less time in the trash can and in distructive activities like toilet paper shredding because he has to work physically and mentally for his meals like animals do in the wild.  It also occupies him while we aren't at home.  It lasts so much longer than a kong, because you can put a whole meal in it.  This is also great because you don't have to feel guilty about giving your dog too many unhealthy treats -- dog food in the jug works great because the kibble is the perfect size.<br /><br />I was watching the video of the woman who put in a negative review, and as an amateur dog trainer, I think I know why.  If you help your dog get food out of the jug, they quickly learn that the way to get food out of the jug is to bring it to the owner, so don't help your dog -- that ruins the fun of the toy!  Also, it's harder to get treats out of the toy if it isn't somewhat full, so just fill it up with dog food and a few treats in the beginning so it's not so difficult that the dog looses interest.  It also helps to put a few treats in the jug so they randomly hit a jackpot when playing with it.  As someone who's studied animal behavior, I know random rewards are the most powerful way to get an animal addicted to a behavior!<br /><br />In short, I can't say enough about this toy!",gAAAAABoh1-9EgxS3S_w7OX3k4HOlwTbUVOjk9NAmbO4lCxUtZrgGFiFORUxBo3ufEdYcEf8szd_J0RUziA1C6sGuNz7liMJYT9iDwQr0KX6mktFnJ7XZzj-gBiOy4v5Br7-lLHleXNJ,"AKHumble ""Harvard Preacher Momma""",first couple days dog moby slightly interested tugajug kept though finally figured system getting dog food jug hooked started putting meals jug instead bowl since starting meals jug moby outlet curious energy spends less time trash distructive activities like toilet paper shredding work physically mentally meals like animals wild also occupies arent home lasts much longer kong put whole meal also great dont feel guilty giving dog many unhealthy treats dog food jug works great kibble perfect sizei watching video woman put negative review amateur dog trainer think know help dog get food jug quickly learn way get food jug bring owner dont help dog ruins fun toy also harder get treats toy isnt somewhat full fill dog food treats beginning difficult dog looses interest also helps put treats jug randomly hit jackpot playing someone whos studied animal behavior know random rewards powerful way get animal addicted behaviorin short cant say enough toy,positive,2008-06

So, it's back to the plastic golf balls, and hopefully it will take her some while to get to the stage of cracking the bottle again, but I suspect it's only a question of time.<br /><br />The manufacturers, IMO, need to implement two improvements.<br /><br />1) The rope needs to be impregnated with something which tastes unpleasant.<br /><br />2) The spikes on the rubber ball need to be made longer and firmer to try to protect the neck of the bottle.<br /><br />Those reservations aside, our dog loves the toy, but then she has a very high food drive, probably due to her months as a stray.",gAAAAABoh1-9AjdaONENtSvYCYU5lTb1STxDL2zBf5HXen05Z0bnGwMciq1QH6ZQ6vemjsht2-r1v-XTgFgTOvEUzWqwNz-jwS1-whvj9-PG1oY-MIEO3Q8=,brian@meadows.pair.com,toy failing dog whos clever good rope weak point understand theory dog supposed use rope chuck bottle around food come couple days collie picked toy took across bed started determinedly chewing ropethe manufacturer recommends put plastic practice golf balls jug instead rope worked dog started chewing purple ball end bottle shed got sufficiently managed crack neck bottle itselfwe got replacement took weeks crack first bottle time rope lasted less two days back plastic golf balls hopefully take get stage cracking bottle suspect question timethe manufacturers imo need implement two improvements1 rope needs impregnated something tastes unpleasant2 spikes rubber ball need made longer firmer try protect neck bottlethose reservations aside dog loves toy high food drive probably due months stray,neutral,2012-03

This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.<br /><br />I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old, 4lb Morkie. My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.<br /><br />He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat. Both you and your pup will be pleased with it.<br /><br />21 March 2012 Update<br /><br />I have since removed the back end of the jug and my dog will now play with it, in fact he expects for me to put all his food in it so he can chase it around and dig them out with his paws and nose.

My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.

I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand, I work at a vet). Its an expensive, invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!<br /><br />My dislikes for the TAJ are:<br /><br />*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....<br /><br />*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope, but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes, bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.<br /><br />*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy, yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking, but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers, as I don't think this would stand up to pits, rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design.

We usually fill the container with a mix of his kibble and some cut up treats for a total of about a 1/4 of a cup and it keeps him occupied for about 30-45 minutes at a time.  We haven't tried adding balls to the jug yet to increase the difficulty, but we may do so soon.<br /><br />This toy has been a savior to help occupy him while we are busy trying to do things around the house, such as cook dinner or do laundry.  I also give it to him to prevent boredom as well as help get rid of some excess energy that he still may have at night since he will push, drag, and carry it all over the place as he is trying to get out the contents.  After a month of use, the only thing that has some signs of wear and tear is the rope.  Our puppy hasn't done any damage to the actual jug yet.<br /><br />On a side note, I have seen the smaller ones in the store that have rubber/plastic ropes, which do not seem to be very durable, but ours was an actual rope, as in the picture and has held up great with our dog.

I have a Chihuahua-shaped vacuum cleaner of a dog who is utterly obsessive about food, and a neurotic Shep/Lab mix who will turn her nose up at food in a bowl, yet gobble up ""found"" food. These toys are the ideal solution for both dogs. The Chih works harder to get the food out (we have the med/large size jugs, so they're pretty big for him to manipulate), which means he's burning off calories. He tends to be a bit of a chub, so this is a good thing. The Shep/Lab mix has an easier time of it, but the toy keeps her occupied and she seems to enjoy it. I've just adopted another dog from the shelter, and gave her her own Tug-a-Jug. It's great for her b/c she has to stay crated a lot right now (healing from her spay surgery, plus the vet put her on very restricted activity while she recovers from an upper respiratory infection). I make sure to put the jugs away when I leave the house (don't want anyone fighting over food), but they're wonderful for when I'm working from home and need to keep the dogs busy while I'm on the phone with clients.

For the treats to come out, the dog needs to pull on the rope and whip the bottle around. Because of the shape of the bottle, the kibble will not spill out on its own while lying on its side. I would think that holding onto the rope and whipping it around would be quite dangerous for the dog as well as anyone standing nearby - the bottle is made from hard plastic and would definitely hurt if it hit you.<br /><br />I decided to remove the rope completely and tried putting in a little ball to slow down the flow of the kibble. That didn't work either - the ball completely blocked the opening (maybe I'll try again with a smaller ball). In the end, I just ended up putting a larger treat (a small milkbone biscuit) in with the kibble and that seemed to work a little better. My puppy is able to get the treats to spill out by tipping the bottle upright. I think I need to experiment more with different sized balls or milkbone biscuits so the kibble spills out easily, but not too easily.<br /><br />On the plus side, the large opening on the bottom of the bottle is great. It makes it very easy to fill the bottle with kibble or treats.<br /><br />I gave this product a 3 because it does what I wanted - it slows down my puppy's eating and keeps him busy for a little while, but for us, it didn't work the way it was intended to work and has the possibility of injuring the dog.",gAAAAABoh1-90DcfpMUFd-WHzPJ8ghYBgwcwpxjjvzq_EV4K-iHvfCuYMGCkvTzjFNFaBnqPRy6yF-ZIA0CQ8qV5GEbF3Jc2MA==,photogirl,even though used small puppy kibble puppy could get kibble bottle treats come dog needs pull rope whip bottle around shape bottle kibble spill lying side would think holding onto rope whipping around would quite dangerous dog well anyone standing nearby bottle made hard plastic would definitely hurt hit youi decided remove rope completely tried putting little ball slow flow kibble didnt work either ball completely blocked opening maybe ill try smaller ball end ended putting larger treat small milkbone biscuit kibble seemed work little better puppy able get treats spill tipping bottle upright think need experiment different sized balls milkbone biscuits kibble spills easily easilyon plus side large opening bottom bottle great makes easy fill bottle kibble treatsi gave product 3 wanted slows puppys eating keeps busy little us didnt work way intended work possibility injuring dog,neutral,2010-08

The rope knot inside the jug can also block the entrance, so I was careful to make sure that the knot was well inside the jug. And I made sure to fill the jug about 3/4 full because the jug can clog if it's totally full and I didn't want them to be discouraged if it was too unrewarding.

We have tried toys that are for aggressive chewers, many only last a day!  If she can't get it started one of her brothers help her out.  She is smart and needs to think as she chews.  We came across the Tug-a-Jug and decided to give it a try.  She took to it right away.  It has holes in the bottom so the smell of the treats continue to hold her interest.  The screw-on lid has fine threads so she can not unscrew it.  The rope cord is frayed on the inside to hold in the treats for longer play time.  The unit is made from strong plastic and is too big around for her to use her powerful jaws to crack it.  The rubber ball end is a good place for her to hold as she carries it around the house. Once I fill this toy with food I know she will be ingrossed for at least an hour while she works on getting all the treats.  A couple of things to keep in mind, the treats add to the dogs calorie intake so you have to cut down on meal time, and it can be a weapon if your dog likes to throw it around (I know this from experience!).

While out in public, he receives lots of stimulation, and if I'm asked first, he receives a lot of attention too.<br /><br />As a service dog, he's with me 24 seven.  Everywhere, everyday, all the time. He's a high energy dog, loves playing fetch with balls, but doesn't much like my tv, computer, or napping time. I love him dearly but everyone needs a little away time.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of Busy Buddy toys for him.  The number of Squirrels at two different sizes, and cut the bottom fingers different lengths so some drop out treats easier, some harder.  He enjoys them, they bounce funny, but he can empty them pretty quickly.  Which leads to them being dropped on my lap repeatedly, and not always in the best place.<br /><br />I found the tug a Jug which I didn't expect to last a long time because of the hard plastic jug. I also figured he'd pull the rubber tug out by now time.  Much to my surprise, he's been playing with it for almost a year with none of the problems I'd expected, other than having it dropped on my foot or lap.<br /><br />I've been able to use his normal brand of Kirkland Chicken & Rice kibbles dog food, mixed in with some Beniful for a change of pace. By using his normal kibble, it keeps the cost down, and allows me to adjust his meal portion size accordingly.<br /><br />It's also about the only toy he doesn't bring out to the back yard to hide and then can't find it again.  Which sends me a clear message he is very focused on this toy.<br /><br />Even though he's a large size dog, I didn't buy him the large size, in part because I prefer the rubber tug, in part it keeps the amount of treats down.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toy (and toy line) for their design and not making it impossible to use normal kibble instead of expense treat products designed only for their toys.<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars if they'd made the outside of the bottle with a rubber coating, or rubber bumpers so it isn't so noisy on non carpeted flooring.",gAAAAABoh1-9lzUmDamTKL9wrjWxbAYt-L5zDt0e6BnVLBruxFNKZlVko8JAqK6TDD4JBtyHPHa6mvcOnZwqMky72ZbPzLWQ6Q==,Obiburner,german shepard dog trained service dog public receives lots stimulation im asked first receives lot attention tooas service dog hes 24 seven everywhere everyday time hes high energy dog loves playing fetch balls doesnt much like tv computer napping time love dearly everyone needs little away timeive purchased number busy buddy toys number squirrels two different sizes cut bottom fingers different lengths drop treats easier harder enjoys bounce funny empty pretty quickly leads dropped lap repeatedly always best placei found tug jug didnt expect last long time hard plastic jug also figured hed pull rubber tug time much surprise hes playing almost year none problems id expected dropped foot lapive able use normal brand kirkland chicken rice kibbles dog food mixed beniful change pace using normal kibble keeps cost allows adjust meal portion size accordinglyits also toy doesnt bring back yard hide cant find sends clear message focused toyeven though hes large size dog didnt buy large size part prefer rubber tug part keeps amount treats downi highly recommend toy toy line design making impossible use normal kibble instead expense treat products designed toysid given 5 stars theyd made outside bottle rubber coating rubber bumpers isnt noisy non carpeted flooring,positive,2010-03

I got this last summer for my very anxious, smart 2 year old pit bull rescue to keep him occupied while working. He is very destructive to his toys but doesn't eat what he destroys. He spends an hour or more a day playing with it , not including while we aren't home. At first I fed him only from this toy, but now he's calmer so I feed him in his bowl too, but he generally prefers to feed out of the toy. I knew when buying he would chew the plastic rope off immediately, and he did. Some come with a nylon rope, which would take longer to chew off. Since I have the large, and the rope is gone, I put in one or more large treats (depending on how hard to dispense I want to make it) and regular size hard dog food and a few small treats that will fit through the neck. The rope definitely blocks well and can be replaced; for me it was easier to put a larger dog treat in to block. With the rope I needed to use small bite dog food because it came out very slowly, and he would lose interest.  Interestingly he loves the enlarged end of the plastic rope to chew on (not good for swallowers). Very sturdy and easy to fill as long as you line up the spirals. He's never opened it. He knocks it around with his paws and nose and grabs the neck with his mouth and throws it around. So far no damage, but it is sturdy and could possibly break something when tossed. Worth the slight risk. After almost 8 months he began to chew off the plastic ring around the neck, which he loved doing, and does attract him to the neck where the treats come out. Recently he started chewing the neck off, which is why I'm buying another, but I plan on using this one until he gets down to where the neck is gone, as it still works and he still loves it.",gAAAAABoh1-9-rEXksz_JKNsbqjKZFstiBuPDOEF5VcRHHzPH3pZEcjD2oKyfNTVu-C6Dknzj6tkhlMpb-kTJIL7HBfB82e21mTBiJ0prdnYba4gjfTtRto=,"P.

He needs to be mentally stimulated so I bought this toy for him. He gets his dinner through this jug sometimes.<br /><br />I was nervous about purchasing it because of the reviews stating how the rubber ""rope"" was easily chopped, but I figured I might be able to replace it with a real rope if it breaks. To my surprise, the purple rope hasn't broke and I had this toy for several months now. My dog has been chewing it with his molars, but not very often. Also he may not be as a strong chewer as the dogs from other reviews.<br /><br />When my dog first recieved this toy, he kept pawing at it and pushing it with his nose panting with exsaustion. It took about an hour until he almost got the one cup of kibble that was in it. Later he got used to it and now he has a strategy. He pushes the back of the bottle straight up. He can empty the bottle in about 10 minutes now.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this toy is that the rubber spikes and the rope gets pretty nasty. It picks up hair from the carpet and dry food crumbs from the kibble inside the bottle and builds up to a disgusting slimy gunk.

This is the best toy I've found yet to keep my overly smart dog challenged.<br /><br />I've used Kongs filled with loose kibble, then kibble mixed with yogurt, kibble mixed with cream cheese or peanut butter, then kibble mixed with one of those and frozen. After 2 months of increasingly challenging Kongs, my dog finally graduated to the point that Kongs don't keep her busy or engaged for long. I also had been filling the Premier Waggle with her kibble, and she takes care of those pretty quickly too and seems to have gotten bored of the one repetitive move she used to get food out.<br /><br />So I got the tug-a-jug. My dog figured out how to get food out right away, which was disappointing -- then I realized I could put big chunks of treats in there to make it smell enticing and harder for the smaller food kibbles to come out. It works!<br /><br />I love that you can customize how hard it is for your dog to get food out by putting in objects that are too big to come out. I filled about half the jug with freeze-dried liver. Then, I put about half a cup of kibble per meal. It takes my dog a good half hour to get out all her kibble, and she really seems to love shoving, nosing, and flinging the jug around. She used a greater variety of movements than with the waggle, which is probably more fun for her.<br /><br />I also love that the jug is SO easy to fill! Kongs and even the waggle are annoying because they have small holes you have to shove the treats into, but the entire bottom of the jug screws off so you can just scoop the food in.

Other treat dispensing toys have gotten chewed up quickly and this one hasn't. Benji is an easy keeper and doesn't need much food. If we put his morning ration of 1/4 cup of kibble in the tug-a-jug it takes him about 40 minutes to get it all out and by that time he's panting with exertion.<br /><br />I do *not* recommend this toy for use on bare floors if you are there to supervise as you probably should be. The jug itself is very hard plastic and Benji could care less about manipulating the ""rope"" to get the treats out: he simply throws the jug around until food comes out. If I were to give him this toy in our kitchen the noise would drive me crazy. On our carpeted living room floor the noise is tolerable.<br /><br />The only distraction that works better is a bully stick which of course is silent but they are expensive and I don't like to use them every day.

We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4.

It takes her about 40 minutes to get a cup of kibble from it.  It is great for her mentally and physically.  It has also been a tremendous help to her digestion, as she was a ""competive eater"" when we adopted her, always wolfing down her food in seconds, and as a result having ""intestinal turbulence"" with alarming frequency.  The tug a jug forces her to eat slowly.  It took her a while to get the hang of it, so it was a supplement, not a substitute, for her regular meals at first.  But now that she knows how it works, I usually feed her one of her two meals in it each day.  The other day, I actually split her dinner between the food bowl and the tug a jug, and she opted to play with the tug a jug for 25 minutes before going for the ""easy meal"" in her bowl.  I can't think of a better endorsement than that!  The one drawback is that it breaks down somewhat easily.  We are on our third tug a jug.  Each previous one has lasted about a month before our dog has bent the end the food goes in enough that it can't be closed anymore.  So, we buy three at a time now.  They're not that expensive, and I think they're totally worth it.",gAAAAABoh1-9-Jot-tzzHNPFVmB41bXdIo1ZXVsxpkMKAcaN4_4Hb1_0GlqQImA_vEGbvxRnfPcSMVNdKhTlpCXUuFXKLXe6mA==,Avid Reader,dog absolutely loves toy takes 40 minutes get cup kibble great mentally physically also tremendous help digestion competive eater adopted always wolfing food seconds result intestinal turbulence alarming frequency tug jug forces eat slowly took get hang supplement substitute regular meals first knows works usually feed one two meals day day actually split dinner food bowl tug jug opted play tug jug 25 minutes going easy meal bowl cant think better endorsement one drawback breaks somewhat easily third tug jug previous one lasted month dog bent end food goes enough cant closed anymore buy three time theyre expensive think theyre totally worth,positive,2012-01

I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.

It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed - it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck-down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had - the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost-effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc) - anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it - on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!",gAAAAABoh1-961s0ASOYDyYxCsMyZaSOPUBQ4qk-4xfajjKmjUwJH0GtyN79UT7eTqlMIh0kRe5bOLVOd3LsmMyrPKeg2oRPXw==,Baking B,toy great keeps aussie cattle dog engaged working food every meal makes think strategize every angle known patience comes getting food toys shell easily shred rip apart whatever get food efficient way possible less 24hours teaching thing works figured rope keeping food inside promptly took bed ate rope initially disappointed sturdy cotton rope watching inhale food literally would tip neckdown mouth pour food rope stop food decided put objects inside bottle make challenging since rope idea seemed little easy started two golf balls moved two racquette balls tennis ball tennis ball almost impossible get food large food wont move around went back racquette balls far good beats thing floor throws walls gnaws like covered frozen peanut butter holds like dream shes gone inhaling food 30 seconds taking almost 2 full minutes eat mealother reviews mentioned flimsy plastic weve found great made sturdy thick plastic far shes scratched little outside others complained rope issues dog unravels chews adding objects inside toy help block food simple extremely costeffective way altering toy make easier difficult change sometimes racquette balls small wood blocks variety smaller objects plastic gatorade caps golf balls etc anything big come neck large enough block food without impossible weve started putting places work get eat chair open box hidden pillow floor etc whole lot effort part pays spades shes mentally tired hour dinner,positive,2011-09

My dog is a very fast eater when I feed her from her bowl, so I was delighted to try this.  I've used Buster Cubes in the past, and still really like them, but my Labrador has figured out how to remove the center piece that controls the difficulty so food spills out easily.  Buster Cubes aren't much of a challenge for her anymore.<br /><br />When I put my dog's dinner into the Tug-A-Jug last night, for the first time, she looked at me as if I had played a cruel joke on her.  She saw the food in the toy, looked at me, cocked her head, and went to her food bowl.  I encouraged her to play with the toy, and she quickly figured out that she could get pieces of kibble by rolling the toy around, picking it up and dropping it, etc.  Right now, she is eating her breakfast, tail wagging, as she manipulates the Tug-A-Jug to get the kibble out.  It's only her second meal from the Tug-A-Jug, so we'll see how long this treat-dispensing toy lasts.  :)<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Today is the 4th day of use for this toy.

My plan was to put this one away as soon as my dog was done with her food so she wouldn't ""play"" with it and chew through the rope. So in other words, I blame my dog's destructive terrier prowess on the demise of the first toy rather than the manufacturer.<br /><br />But after just one week of use for the second toy, the bottom part where the end seals onto the main container literally cracked and shattered into many pieces when I was sealing the toy.<br /><br />My dog may chew through ropes but she's not that rough with toys, and I was using normal strength to twist the end piece on, so I'm pretty sure this one was a dud.

My dog Loooooves it and eats his dinner out of it every night. Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!<br />UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!",gAAAAABoh1-9nrjEHYb2D_NJKN3QpjFL5XJ4p2koi-oa2pIH62UiEjNQVI1lHEBQioLKKwjUpUazJVuRSE5rbpfTlM-WR7zCRQ==,keysgirl,3rd jug dog loooooves eats dinner every night first two rubber rope first rubber rope destroyed foster puppy ate everything sight second rubber rope started dissolve prolonged coating kibble crumbs drool figured time buy third one one used almost 1 year 2 meals day held 700 uses bad one arrived soooo disappointed cotton braided rope reviewers prefer dog destroyed rubber rope seems dog could chew apart robber rope could destroy cotton one problem cotton version works first kind stiff drooly dog softened rope making harder get kibble time braiding loosened bit making fatter day could get anything gave home know must tried looonnggg time giving jug successfully used well year sure confused working major beef used take rubber rope hand dishwasher new rope knotted ends removed cant unknot without cutting rope going soooo bummed way slowing dog meal time looking something substitute rope wish left well enough aloneupdate contacted premier customer service confirmed suspected people prefer cotton rope however offered send replacement rubber rope left sent promptly charge awesome company would recommend trying since prefer cotton rope may like much rubber rope,positive,2010-05

The first thing I did was put some in my dry hair to absorb for a few hours. After shampooing, my hair was MUCH softer than it was before. I've put few drops on my ends 2 more times since then and my hair is soooo soft now! In that time, I've used it as a face and body moisturizer and it does NOT make my dry acne prone face break out. Be careful though, coconut oil is not a thick oil so a little goes a loooong way (which is a great thing!). Smells SO good on my skin, gives it a slight, mild toasted coconut smell.<br />I've cooked eggs, kielbasa and pulled pork with it so far and it makes the tastes of those things richer, which is a pleasant surprise. No overpowering coconut taste, just a slight ""ummph"" to the flavor of things I've cooked so far with it.<br /><br />I even like licking the spoon after I've dipped it in the container to get some oil.<br /><br />Right now, I keep it on my kitchen counter in a cruet (oil drizzler) and it is liquid which is fine by me.

The coconut taste is a little bit stronger than what you'd find in movie theatres but overall a bit bland (which is not a bad thing).  I frankly prefer that than trading the health benefits for overly processed oil.  That and while I love coconut trading the near tasteless flavor of the oil for a strong coconut flavor would reduce it's versatility in cooking.<br /><br />So when you salt this lightly with popcorn it stands on its own.  But I season mine with kernel's seasons, splenda, sugar, some salty butter flavoring along with melted Nutiva, mixed then drizzled on top.  In short, it's one step short of heaven and the switch from Canola is immediate and amazing.  I honestly can't stop eating it and it is rather healthy in comparison to movie theatre popcorn as I use far less and still has a very similar oil fragrance and taste.  Yes I still treat it like an oil and use about 2.5 to 3 tablespoons for a 1/3 cup of unpopped corn.<br /><br />On that note, while I applaud the brave reviewers out there who put this on their hair, and eat it religiously daily this is still an oil.  Perhaps a high quality one and one I may put on my split ends one day, but to me this is a yummy cooking oil you use in moderation.<br /><br />It also is a tad expensive (hence subbing a star) and again I do find it too bland to use alone on toasted bread (perhaps it has to be toasted together in the toaster oven) but the quality and convenience is really good.<br /><br />So if you happen to use it in other ways, good on you but I am happy with using it sparingly, and simply for popcorn.  It seems much more useful to me than using it as the latest and greatest in health fads today.  Especially because oil, even when healthy, contributes a hefty amount of calories and fat to your diet.<br /><br />==========================================================<br />Note about the Coconut Oil Hype<br /><br />Seems like a few people are very into the hype, so much so that if you do not write an overly glorifying review of coconut oil something is wrong with you.  I'm not a believer in ONLY scientific studies and if that were the case I would not care for reviews by buyers from amazon.  And frankly I love you reviwers as you save me time and money.  However I do have a limit on what I hear from the internet.  And whenever there is the word ""miracle"" attached to something in the title I use a heavy amount of skepticism.  And MANY people believe coconut and coconut oil is a ""miracle"".<br /><br />Sorry folks it isn't.  I do realize all the benefits of coconut water by the way. Coconut water is extremely healthy and even used as in emergencies to substitute for human blood, but even so I would hesitate to call coconut water a ""miracle"" as drinking it alone is not a cure for aids, cancer, etc. as suggested by some. That, to me would constitute a true miracle. And if it were true, coconuts would have been discovered a long time ago as a cure for aids/cancer, etc.<br /><br />Coconut water is undoubtedly good FOR you and I love coconuts as a whole but do use some discretion when eating OIL.<br /><br />To me, if you're thin, eating fat is not so much an issue when the fat is healthier and you probably need some caloric substance. Extra virgin coconut oil, while still being researched, comes from a coconut and thusly is inherently healthy to some degree. However, if you're already overweight, then eating 3 tablespoons of oil, ANY oil, on TOP of what you eat amounts to 390+ calories extra which means you gain a pound in only 10 days.  It is VERY easy to overeat oil and that said I would really hesitate to overuse coconut oil or any oil without extensive studies.<br /><br />So those reading what I wrote, as of March 3rd, 2011 coconut oil is still being heavily studied.  Just google it if the following links do not show.<br />[...]If you're on the fence, don't consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies ARE done.  If it's oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  Don't buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you're already overweight.",gAAAAABoh1-9Eg1ZNotgDiS9jHXFBCRTsbKTF7Sa8xpzB52n81Jc0Cimh5FUpP8lCuBoIjSKbOMRJnj8bDcnkmW_f2oEsz_OWA==,M.

For folks with kinky hair this is a wonderful sealant to lock moisture into your hair. Think it's most useful if placed in hair AFTER a leave-in conditioner or other moisturizer. By itself, doesn't seem to moisturize - just sort of sits on the surface, looking greasy for a while. So after you've moisturized, rub a small amount of Nutiva between your hands and then lightly work it through your hair, with attention to your ends. Give it a few minutes to soak in to avoid the soul glo look: at first it will of course be shiny, but it soaks in very quickly and then your hair just looks lush and healthy (unless you get heavy handed with it - then it will stay looking greasy. Go light...you can always add a little more later). It's also a good sealant to use on your skin after putting on body moisturizer.<br /><br />Great in the kitchen too. Can use in pretty much anything, with excellent results. Recommend using this for anything you're going to heat, and saving the olive oil for cold dishes. There are a million other uses for coconut oil, so it's worth taking some time to look into. Cold pressed, virgin, organic coconut oil is what you want. Like with most oils, this one will change consistency depending on the temperature, but even when it solidifies, it will quickly liquify again if you rub it between your hands or heat it.

Expect Greasy Delivery in Hot Weather.,"The benefits of organic Coconut Oil are endless and this brand is wonderful.  Another reviewer had warned about ordering cocounut oil in hot weather days. Coconut oil is liquid at room temperature, so it'll probably leak & evaporate from jar at 85*F+  (wildly guessing here).<br /><br />If you look at the same item in FL store shelves, their jars are kinda greasy too especially in the spring/summer months.<br /><br />I got my shipment today. Amazon did a superb job in packaging. And yet no matter how well packaged, the jars in bubble wrap, plastic bag & box, leaked the same.<br /><br />Gotta expect the oil to leak from jar while in transit in hot weather and also be prepared to do some smart cleaning upon receipt.  I suggest leaving jars in bubble wrap + bag. Place all on paper towels and put inside fridge for 1/2 hr. When oil is solid, remove wrappings. Rinse jars under warm water, use oil residue on hands, arms, face (never let a good crisis go to waste!)  Inspect lids & seals. All should be intact, maybe just a tad oily. After rinsing & once product is partially solid, there should be NO leaking from anywhere. If so, then the jar must be cracked. Remove oil and place in another container -- a glass jar would be best.<br /><br />The product is great and perhaps worth the hassle if ordering in hot days. Another option, would be to place orders in cooler months. No mess.

I learned that coconut oil consists of predominately medium-chain fatty acids which digest more easily, are the kinds of fats in mother's milk, and are preferentially used by the liver as a source of fuel to produce energy.<br /><br />Cooking can significantly affect many fats and oils causing the formation of toxic compounds. However, coconut oil is safe for cooking because it is the oil with the largest amount of saturated fatty acids and the least amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Ninety-two percent is saturated and only 1.5 percent is polyunsaturated. You can use coconut oil for cooking without having to worry about it harming your health. It is so stable you can reheat the oil and use it several times without damaging it. Not only does coconut not form harmful toxins when heated, but it also has many health benefits.<br /><br />For more information on coconut oil benefits, I recommend Dr. Bruce Fife's books on the subject.<br /><br />I love the taste of this oil and use it almost exclusively for cooking.  I put it in our morning oatmeal for a wonderful coconut flavor and the added health benefits that it gives.

What I didn't like was the new upgraded opaque white jar that Nutiva now uses for the coconut oil. I have found that when coconut oil liquefies in hot weather some of the oil seeps through the bottom of the jar. I think it might be due to the process in which they make their new opaque plastic jars. There is a line in the middle where the two parts of plastic where joined together or where the plastic was molded and separated from the mold.  At the bottom of the jar the oil leaks through this mold line. In summer temperatures I have found some residual oil left at the bottom of the surface where I leave the jar. This was not a problem with the previous jars. Nutiva should address this problem right away.,gAAAAABoh1-9VbsjTA4ALRrJZvH1zTqWNZLSt67nJYETm6kmFbWC8P5IFsqKMg3q7G85-ZoECvlvamR3FG0t6Nsd3KupzVNvhA==,Abran,really enjoy oil great cooking many uses well didnt like new upgraded opaque white jar nutiva uses coconut oil found coconut oil liquefies hot weather oil seeps bottom jar think might due process make new opaque plastic jars line middle two parts plastic joined together plastic molded separated mold bottom jar oil leaks mold line summer temperatures found residual oil left bottom surface leave jar problem previous jars nutiva address problem right away,positive,2012-09

First, I admit it's the first and only one I've tried, but after reading scores of reviews and my holistic health practitioner suggesting I take in 2 Tbsp. a day, I wanted the best. And at Amazon, you get the best prices, especially with Subscribe & Save (how great is that?)!<br /><br />When I opened the jar the very first time, I was amazed at the deliciously fresh coconut aroma. It's intoxicating! I do like coconut, so that helps. But it took me a while to get up the nerve to heat it up and pour it into my frozen fruit smoothie (frozen banana, strawberries, blueberries, juice). I thought somehow it'd solidify back up and I'd get big chunk-o-fat globules in my shake. Not at all!<br /><br />When I heated it up on the stove so that it'd liquify, the scent was of toasted coconut (mmmm, so yummy), so I thought it'd taste great in my smoothie. What surprised me was that it added no taste at all. I'm now using it every day, as suggested.<br /><br />Then it took me a while to try frying with it because I figured it'd impart mild coconut flavor to my savory dishes (potatoes, chicken, eggs), which I wouldn't want. But I just tried it over the past two days, a little with scrambled eggs and a lot with searing boneless breasts of chicken (which were finished in the oven on a tray coated with more coconut oil). I tasted zero coconut flavor in any of it! I am so psyched about this! So now I'll be using organic olive oil for dressings and other raw applications and coconut oil with nearly everything else.<br /><br />Also, I read that the plastic tubs it comes in are BPA-free...fabulous!

I've tried several brands, but nothing tastes as clean and pure as this.  There is a definite undertone of coconut, but I like the flavor, even when frying eggs or eating it on cinnamon raisin toast. I recently had bloodwork done and my HDL (the good cholesterol) was an impressive 77---anything over 39 is considered in range; over 50 is heart protective).  I attribute this great HDL number to using only coconut oil, butter, and olive oil in my cooking & drinking green tea.<br /><br />Amazon's Subscribe & Save offer is a great deal; I really like the 2 pack of these smaller (15 oz) jars.  We're a small household and I like keeping one jar sealed while using the other.  Keep in mind that coconut oil is different than other oils--it is solid at temperatures under 72, so it will look something like shortening in the wintertime.  Still tastes great and is wonderful to use in all kinds of cooking.<br /><br />One more important detail:  this is an organic, COLD PRESSED coconut oil.  Others may be organically grown, but I've found some brands are hydrogenated to make them solid at room temperature (I won't go into all the reasons this is not a ""good thing"").

Very clean on the tongue with just a slight back hint of coconut flavour. YES, this WILL slightly flavour some of your dishes to taste faintly of coconut if the dish is not heavily spiced. When I use coconut oil in place of butter for many Ethiopian and Indian dishes, I don't really notice any coconut flavour--but these are heavily spiced cuisines and so the sheer level of spice involved will cover up the delicate coconut flavour of this oil. In baking, however, there is a wonderful little hint of it. When I've made cookies and cakes using this in place of shortening or butter, many people have commented that something felt different about the dessert, but they couldn't put their finger on it right away until I would suggest coconut. I say all of this, though, in case someone who absolutely HATES coconut is considering using coconut oil as a part of their diet. While it has many great health benefits, if you cannot stand the flavour of coconut in any shape or form, you probably will not enjoy this product. I personally enjoy the added depth and dimension is gives my food, as well as the fact it's cholesterol free.<br /><br />If you're thinking this wouldn't taste like anything, then you're thinking of what is called ""RBD coconut oil"", that is to say, coconut oil which has been refined, bleached, and deodorised. This is not that product, and in my opinion, is far superior to any RBD coconut oil you could find.<br /><br />Now, the health benefits. Coconut gets props for being cholesterol free. Many people want to downplay its wonderfulness by pointing out that it is loaded in saturated fats. However! The saturated fats found in coconut oil are mostly medium-chain fatty acids, which bind together to form medium-chain triglycerides. Medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs, are much easier for the body to break down and process than long-chain triglycerides, which are the saturated fats that are usually predominant in our diets. Because MCTs are so easily broken down in the body, they don't put a great strain on your pancreas or digestive system. Coconut oil is not a cure-all, however. It's not some miracle food (IMO), but I do think it should be seen as a healthy, viable alternative to butter and some cooking oils. Should it replace these other oils and butter outright? No, I don't think so. But I think it deserves a place of respect alongside your butter and olive oil in the kitchen.",gAAAAABoh1-9gYn7xxjyFpQap3Xfkn8bTEJXLF7eQ6px4F-W07YSHiJn5LUsS06baXrex_UpEPVQjGUePTrE5mRw_PRG9VX5RQ==,K.

For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find ""packed on"" and ""best before"" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the ""best before"" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as ""organic."" Do a little research; ""cold-pressed,"" ""organic,"" AND ""hexane-free"" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar.",gAAAAABoh1-9AOxtatdTYuxTWn4XbAX4OHudKf-Y9HP6ETwm_UMnxcNMTbUXwayiAZ3qkkoW4RlFDlA1ra40ajMsj93K9Cy2cw==,Observant I,ive tried different brands extravirgin coconut oil part im equally satisfied despite marketing hype coconut oil brands within category virgin refined hydrogenated similar specify qualities look coconut oil want coconut oil rich coconut aroma taste maximum nutrition minimal processing reasons always select organic extravirgin coldpressed oilim pleased nutiva organic extravirgin coconut oil provides qualities along easytofind packed best date jars ordered late january 2011 packed september 13 2010 best date september 13 2012 stored correctly cool dark location refrigeration needed nutrientdense oil stays fresh two years smells tastes greatcoconutty slightly sweetaccording nutiva hexane used processing oil hexane petroleumderived solvent used kinds industrial applications shoe manufacturing roofing interestingly hexanes primary molecular structure carbon passed organic little research coldpressed organic hexanefree key considerations selecting coconut oil nutrition purposesim pleased plastic jars fact took star result plastic packaging feel quality organic oil stored glass jar ideally dark one reduce oxidation ive actually selected coconut oils specifically come glass jars might bypassed product hadnt found sale good price put information review aid looking coconut oil glass jar,positive,2011-02

So far, I have used it for (1) extremely dry skin on my face and around my hairline. I could see an improvement after just one day and it's continued until I no longer have patches of dry skin and the skin on my face is glowing. (2) I severely burnt my tongue tasting some soup and the next day it was so painful I could not eat. I coated my tongue several tiimes that day in the coconut oil and it was completely well on the third day. (3) On my grand daughters diaper rash and on her dry flaky feet. Her feet were peeling they were so dry and we cleared it up in a week with the coconut oil. (4) I coated my dry hair in the coconut oil and left it on all day and then shampooed it out before going to bed. My hair was soft and shiny the next day to the point that several people asked me what I had done to my hair. Now I regularly soak my hair in the oil and my hair is beautiful. (5) I made a face scrub with the oil and sugar and it works wonderfully for getting the dead skin off my face and feet at a fraction of the cost of the expensive scrubs and works better and smells good too.<br /><br />The oil does not stay on your skin, it is absorbed quickly and does not stain your clothes or bedding. I ordered two tubs with Subscribe and Save and the price was a real bargain except my sister begged me out of one of my tubs, so now I have to re-order quickly. I don't want to be out. I keep a small jar of the oil on my desk and use it several times a day on my hands and elbows. Those rough ugly elbows will dissappear in a week and you will have smooth white elbows if you just rub some oil in once a day.<br /><br />I have not used the oil for any kind of cooking because that is not the reason I wanted it, but I have read that it is great for use as a cooking oil. I know my grand daughter loves to stick her finger in the jar and lick the oil off. She loves it and I know it will not hurt her.<br /><br />Would I order this again? Yes and yes.

I now live in a place where there are more coconuts than people, but I brought the Nutiva Coconut Oil down here with me, because it's almost 10 dollars for half a liter here.<br /><br />I have found this brand to be the purest coconut oil on the market, at least among those I've been able to find and try. The price is fabulous, can't beat it.<br /><br />The oil will solidify at lower temperatures, it did that often when I lived in Texas. You just scoop it out and use it the same way. Once it sits in a room temp over 70 degrees, it tends to stay clear and in its liquid form. It hasn't solidified at all since I've been in subtropical Mexico. It's not white when in liquid form.<br /><br />I avoid all artificial fats and use coconut and extra virgen olive oil for most cooking and baking now. I have no problem with natural fats as I follow a mostly low-carb diet nowadays, but I still prefer non-animal sources for most fat. The fact that coconut oil has been shown to aid with lowering blood sugar is a big plus for me. I know a lot of people who stir it into their coffee or find other ways to ingest at least 3TB per day, I probably don't get that much, though I know I should.<br /><br />Be aware that this oil doesn't taste much like coconut, important for me because I LOATHE the flavor of coconut. It does smell like it, but I haven't found that it adds any taste at all to what I cook.<br /><br />A caveat: coconut oil has a smoke point that's about as low as olive oil, I believe it's 350 to 375 degrees, so this is not an oil that's suitable for deep-frying. You'll have to stick with peanut oil for that.<br /><br />I've had the second jar open for about 5 months now on the counter and have not noticed any degradation of the smell or cooking results for this oil. It should last quite well when stored unopened, as well.<br /><br />You can also use this as a moisturizer, I've tried it and it does leave my skin VERY soft.",gAAAAABoh1-9yMBeJL3lGUn9k0gs2xMbrJ1WdDJEVoZbcEWXt6KAjY3-9wr09EtXgG79pC1A9MzphIEGwQkPnA-E7_nrDQsEiQ==,D.

Before this she was not able to successfully lose the weight.<br /><br />Nutiva Organic extra virgin (actually in the field of coconut oil there is no distinction between virgin and extra virgin like the grades of olive oil)is the best coconut oil brand for quality due to its true essence of coconut flavor. This is one of the very few companies that keep with the tradition of producing it cold pressed by hand which allows the oil to maintain all of its nutritional benefits.  It's not an over powering oil.  It has a clean, tropical, nutty scent and delicate flavor.<br /><br />It is good for baking, sauteeing, frying, for smoothies, spreadable on bread/pancakes, great for creating frosting, and making dipping chocolate or added with chocolate for fondue, taken orally for weight loss, lip gloss, hot oil treatment for hair, hair dress, massage oil, skin moisturizer, nail/cuticle conditioner, make up remover,  a combatant for vaginal/infections due to coconut's antiviral properties, used to moisten the inner nasal membrane to protect against dryness, and great (especially when combined with olive oil)for making bars of soap.<br /><br />Coconut oil is extremely beneficial for your health because it has both short and medium chain fatty acids which promotes weight loss, increased metabolism, and healthy skin.  Many experience the lowering of bad cholestorol while consuming.<br /><br />It is the secret ingredient I use for sauteeing broccoli and cauliflower with a hint of ginger and nutmeg.  I use it for salmon, lamb, chicken, eggs (yum), and it brings out such a dimension to food.  I prefer it to butter and olive oil in cooking when I have it on hand. My cakes, brownies, quick breads turn out moister with coconut oil and rise better. Because it liquifies beyond 72degress F it may be necessary to combine coconut oil with a heavier fat (such as butter) when baking cookies.<br /><br />Due to it's properties, coconut oil absorbs nicely into one's hair to soften it and combat frizziness.

For oral care it takes about 1 minute to turn into an oil in your mouth and leaves your mouth tasting nice and sweet.

I started cooking with ""healthier"" alternatives--like artificial sweeteners and chemical-loaded, aerosol-powered, partially hydrogenated cooking sprays--also on the advice of the experts.  My food tasted like a tin can, my skin was an oily mess, I felt sluggish all the time, and my jeans hugged me ever more tightly. Thankfully, the conventional wisdom has come full circle, and I've spent the last few years making the grateful journey back to a more natural--and genuinely healthy--way of living. I looked for a good, organic coconut oil at our regular grocer with no luck, so I was glad to find this brand here on Amazon.  I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that say this oil has a ""toasty"" scent.  It does, and that's why I like it.  Its warm, toasty aroma actually smells a little buttery--which is perfect if you're using this as a substitute for butter or margarine.  I've tried other oils that have a more coconut-y aroma, and they also had a sweeter, pronounced fruit-oil flavor that's great for desserts and dressings--but clashed with meats and savory dishes. This coconut oil and EVOO now get nearly equal time in my day-to-day cooking, and the warm ""toastiness"" of this oil adds a richness that enhances other flavors. I can't see it working in place of butter on something like toast or popcorn, but cooking with it gives a noticeably buttery taste to foods. This came in a pack of two tubs, which is convenient since this oil has so many uses. I can have one in the fridge to keep it solid for cosmetic/medicinal use, and the other in the cabinet as an ever-ready liquid for cooking. I'm once again enjoying all the benefits of virgin coconut oil--health, nutrition, beauty, and flavor all in one jar.

It just tastes fresh.<br /><br />And it melts in your hand. And tastes terrific in food.<br /><br />It DOES have a delicious fresh scent, but make no mistake, it does NOT smell like suntan oil.

I usually use EVOO so I was a bit worried about the taste difference.  It defininely smells like coconut, but surprisingly, it is not overly strong.  The taste was pleasant with my veggies.  First try: delicious and easy.<br /><br />Next, I put some on my face as a moisturizer.  Again, the smell was pleasant and mild.  In the past I have also used EVOO on my skin because it is a milder moisturizer than a store bought facial moisturizer.  EVOO takes hours and hours to soak in, so I only use it at night before bed.  I thought the coconut oil would be similar.  I put in on in the evening and sat down to watch a movie.  It was completely absorbed before I even hit the sheets!  And by the time it was absorbed, the smell was gone (not that the smell of coconut on the skin would be a bad thing!) So it is lovely as a facial moisturizer.<br /><br />Then I read on the label that it could be used in place of butter, so I spread some on a cracker and tried it that way.  It was delicious!

I have never had any health complaints and have decided to be proactive about health matters, instead of trying to ""fix"" them as they come along (as long as I'm able, of course). So, in my hours and hours of reading, I came across so many articles, websites and books devoted to coconut oil. I was shocked, that I have never heard of it and I have still not met anyone who uses it.<br /><br />So, I decided I had to try it! The main reason was I read that eating 2-4 teaspoons a day had health benefits, but I have also came across my fair share of home spa recipes for moisturizers using coconut oil as one of there main ingredients. I figured, I couldn't go wrong buying it, because if it didn't taste nice, I could still use it. I'm very happy to report that I was blown away by the taste of this coconut oil! It is not sweet at all but the coconut oil was so reminiscent of a Almond Joy candy bar to me, that I find myself going back for another spoon just to enjoy the delicious flavor..  I'm afraid I'm going to have to reorder more to use in my moisturizer recipes, as I intend to use these two containers to cook with now that I am hooked on this fantastic product.!

It does have a very strong smell of coconut though, and not much flavor to it.<br /><br />I bought this stuff because of some Candida overgrowth issues I've had recently been dealing with (which was caused by too many antibiotics given to me by my doctor) and also for a new found minor eczema problem (probably caused by the Candida overgrowth).<br /><br />So basically I eat and rub this stuff on me all day. Lol.<br /><br />I love the added taste it gives to coffee or tea. It says it can be used as a 'buttery spread on bread' but I can't imagine actually substituting butter for this stuff.<br /><br />I have yet to cook with it, but I'm sure it will work fine.<br /><br />My stomach problems I've been having have seemed to have cleared up.<br /><br />As far as the eczema, it seems to be helping a bit, but not as quickly as Dermarest Eczema lotion did.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RTU4GE"">Dermarest Eczema Medicated Lotion 4 fl oz (118 ml)</a><br /><br />I still find myself scratching a bit, but not nearly as much as before and redness or bumps are gone. However, I am still going to keep using this for my eczema because it is more natural way of clearing it up. After using the Dermarest lotion a few days my heart started pumping slow and hard.<br /><br />One more thing I should mention (why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5) is because I keep forgetting that this stuff melts once it reaches 76 degrees. I inadvertently opened the jar on an angle one day thinking the coconut was still solid and the oil spilled out everywhere!! Definately my own fault, but the jar itself doesn't seem to be the best thing for containing such an oily liquid when it melts. This still would not stop me from purchasing this specific brand though, just don't be an idiot like me and you will be fine.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this brand as I've seen others in stores and they cost about 12 for 1 jar. Amazon had 2 jars for 12. Can't beat that! +++",gAAAAABoh1-9MAqp3b9S_wsfc7AhXbFghN_uTwoTN_MOQAYr188GlVLPJI8N38aqnUEwRCit56AOV4kl1sfpTiF1bNoGndTJPsQDGe5XvW9VextnrVNxCPk=,"Simmer ""itsme0209""",love smell coconut however must say assumed coconuts naturally sugary welli wrong sugar taste stuff strong smell coconut though much flavor iti bought stuff candida overgrowth issues ive recently dealing caused many antibiotics given doctor also new found minor eczema problem probably caused candida overgrowthso basically eat rub stuff day loli love added taste gives coffee tea says used buttery spread bread cant imagine actually substituting butter stuffi yet cook im sure work finemy stomach problems ive seemed cleared upas far eczema seems helping bit quickly dermarest eczema lotion diddermarest eczema medicated lotion 4 fl oz 118 mli still find scratching bit nearly much redness bumps gone however still going keep using eczema natural way clearing using dermarest lotion days heart started pumping slow hardone thing mention gave product 4 stars instead 5 keep forgetting stuff melts reaches 76 degrees inadvertently opened jar angle one day thinking coconut still solid oil spilled everywhere definately fault jar doesnt seem best thing containing oily liquid melts still would stop purchasing specific brand though dont idiot like finei would definitely recommend brand ive seen others stores cost 12 1 jar amazon 2 jars 12 cant beat,positive,2010-04

I've tried other brands but none of them were as good. I like this 15 ounce size better because you can use it up before it gets rancid. I had a much larger container before but it turned before I used it all up, we live in a hot climate so this is a great size to insure it stays fresh. I use one jar as a cosmetic on my skin and hair and we cook and bake with the other jar and use it in smoothies. It tastes great and is wonderful for baking when you want a little coconut flavor substitute it for the oil in the recipe. Great for curry and sambal recipes. Just know that it solidifies if it gets cold so as a salad oil it's not good because it gets hard when it hits cold food. It will do this when used as a marinade on cold seafood or meat but thats a good thing in that case because it stays hardened on the food till you get it on the grill and then it melts into it making it really tasty! There are too many uses to list and now that we know that coconut oil is a healthy oil there is no more guilt.

It has only a subtle coconut scent, which is excellent for low-heat cooking. Although it is recommended for slightly higher heat, the risk of burning the oil is high, yielding an awful synthetic taste and smell.<br /><br />I use coconut oil in my raw vegan desserts. Unfortunately, I live in Florida, which means that the coconut oil itself is always in a liquid state when kept at room temperature. Be forewarned that in the warmer months, you will have a liquid oil, since it ""melts"" at 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 C). If I make a raw cheesecake, it needs to be refrigerated immediately and cannot sit on the counter for very long, But it still does an excellent job! It is also great for the hair and skin; I keep a separate bottle in the bathroom for such uses. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out, and the gentle moisturizing properties of the coconut oil do not irritate my skin or pores at all.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this product, after months of receiving it, was that it was shipped to me once with an open lid. When I received the box, it was coated in oil with a sticker from the post office that it had been received damaged by them (the postal carrier would not even carry it up for me), and damaged a box of books I had shipped separately. However, Amazon was very quick to rectify the issue.<br /><br />A few other reviewers have complained that the oil ""sweats"" and no matter what they do, the outside of the jar becomes oily. I've been through about 6 bottles of oil over the years and have only had this problem when I didn't wipe the bottle off after use.

There was a piece of day old Rosemary Bread on the counter.  I remembered so many people saying this tastes good on bread so I decided to try it.  I admit I stood my the garbage pail because I was expecting to throw the piece of bread with coconut oil spread on it away.  I love this stuff but didn't think I'd go so far as to eat it straight out of the jar.  Wow.  It had a nice smooth buttery taste.  Ate it all.  By the way, Subscribe and Save is the way to go.  Doing it for a year now.  Very satisified with the service.<br /><br />Besides the cooking benefits of coconut oil I've discovered other benefits that make this a must have in my house.  For more years than I can remember I had a wart on one of my fingers.  It would come and go but finally got to the point that when it flaired up it would split, bleed, and get infected.  It was getting very hard to keep under control so had decided that I would finally have to go to a specialist and have it removed.  The last time I had an episode with it I decided to try one last thing...coconut oil. I had read coconut oil had anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties.  Within 2 days the infection had started to clear up.  In less than 10 days the wart had shrunk to practically nothing.  It's been months now.  I use coconut oil on my hands every day...several times a day and haven't had a single new flair up.  After dealing with this for more than 15 years, I can barely feel where the wart was. I've used coconut oil on burns, cold sores, and callused feet (smooth as can be now).  It's also wonderful for keeping my gray hair very soft and manageable.  I had read an article about ""oil pulling"" and tryed it with coconut oil.  I won't go into that here.  Just go to Bing or EHow and check it out.  It has really improved my oral health.  The articles I read suggested oil pulling with sesame oil but I used coconut oil because of it's anti-bacterial qualities.  This is a product I wouldn't be without now.",gAAAAABoh1-9X_xhrFeMOAp4gX4khQlX2Jo2Lm49CZoY8FaBQJIe9d2SvQgWNltaTV8ukwjbtbWqo384iX1UtgByIn8quZHY5Q==,P.

It generated a good discussion spanning 97 comments, however it was not very concise and I wished I had made my points more clearly. This is a rewrite of my initial review.<br /><br />I purchased this product because I had heard stories in the popular media about how coconut oil contains a healthy form of saturated fat. I welcomed this news because coconut oil is a fun ingredient. It has a high smoke point, a great taste, and does not go rancid.<br /><br />As a chemist, the hypothesis for why it may be healthier made sense to me. Coconut oil contains medium chain saturated fats, which differ from the long chain saturated fats found in red meat. I studied lipid transport during my PhD and I think it is totally possible the body does different things with these two different chemicals.<br /><br />However it is also totally possible that the two types of saturated fat both increase one's risk of cardiovascular disease. To figure this out, I looked through the literature and spoke with people to see what proof there was.<br /><br />What I found was that the arguments that suggest medium chain saturated fats are health appeared flawed to me. Here are the arguments I have heard:<br /><br />Some people reference studies of island dwelling-people who eat diets rich in coconut fats. These people have low rates of heart disease. The problems with these studies are significant. First, these people often die earlier than Westerners, and that is why they have lower cardiovascular disease. They have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease too. This is because of the second, larger problem: there are MANY things about the life of an island-dwelling person that is different than that of a Westerner. Maybe the diet is the cause of an observed effect, maybe it is the increased exercise or different sleep pattern. You just can't draw conclusions when so many variables have changed. Islanders are just too different to use as a model.<br /><br />Some people trust books written about the subject like ""The Coconut Oil Miracle"" or ""The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil"". The problem with these books is that they are books, not studies. To prove something, you have to perform a study. To make their arguments, they often cite studies, but the studies are like the one above, typically flawed. There isn't a paper published that shows medium chain saturated fats do not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease the way saturated fats do.<br /><br />There have also been citations from doctors such as Dr. Mercola. It is best to take advice from leaders in the field, rather than doctors trying to sell a book or treatement. Specifically Dr. Mercola has been admonished by the FDA for making misleading claims:  [...] Be careful who you trust.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is no evidence that medium chain saturated fats have different health effects than saturated fats. The most convincing argument in favor of coconut oil is that saturated fats themselves are not dangerous. There is controversy on this subject (just like with most medical subjects) but the vast majority of the data supports the idea that saturated fat increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. To support this, here are some sources.<br /><br />1) Harvard University School of Public Health published this easy guide to fats and cholesterol:<br />[...]<br />Here they recommend that you should not decrease fat intake overall, just replace saturated fats with unsaturated, the less saturated the better.<br />2) The most convincing paper on this subject says this:<br />""Based on consistent evidence from human studies, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat modestly lowers coronary heart disease risk, with ~10% risk reduction for a 5% energy substitution; whereas replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate has no benefit and replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat has uncertain effects. ""<br /> To restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. The authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion.<br />Further research has shown ""The meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%."" That is a huge effect.<br />Citation is here:<br />Lipids. 2010 Oct;45(10):893-905. Epub 2010 Mar 31.<br />Saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence.<br />Micha R, Mozaffarian D.<br />Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.<br />3) Finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. The majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<br />[...]<br /><br />To summarize what I learned from these conversations and articles, I now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and I know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.<br /><br />I decided to take the more conservative path and I sold the coconut oil I bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. I hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.",gAAAAABoh1-9hMdmocZIg7krRy8OFZ-nHsKjX_F8PHi4F5n64vpn6KqfZCruDPf5OvrmAedlf7f-Sur4HAFdfy2s-nrKGPvGBQ==,Laboratory,wrote review product detailing experience product coconut oil general generated good discussion spanning 97 comments however concise wished made points clearly rewrite initial reviewi purchased product heard stories popular media coconut oil contains healthy form saturated fat welcomed news coconut oil fun ingredient high smoke point great taste go rancidas chemist hypothesis may healthier made sense coconut oil contains medium chain saturated fats differ long chain saturated fats found red meat studied lipid transport phd think totally possible body different things two different chemicalshowever also totally possible two types saturated fat increase ones risk cardiovascular disease figure looked literature spoke people see proof waswhat found arguments suggest medium chain saturated fats health appeared flawed arguments heardsome people reference studies island dwellingpeople eat diets rich coconut fats people low rates heart disease problems studies significant first people often die earlier westerners lower cardiovascular disease lower rates alzheimers disease second larger problem many things life islanddwelling person different westerner maybe diet cause observed effect maybe increased exercise different sleep pattern cant draw conclusions many variables changed islanders different use modelsome people trust books written subject like coconut oil miracle healing miracle coconut oil problem books books studies prove something perform study make arguments often cite studies studies like one typically flawed isnt paper published shows medium chain saturated fats increase risk cardiovascular disease way saturated fats dothere also citations doctors dr mercola best take advice leaders field rather doctors trying sell book treatement specifically dr mercola admonished fda making misleading claims careful trustultimately evidence medium chain saturated fats different health effects saturated fats convincing argument favor coconut oil saturated fats dangerous controversy subject like medical subjects vast majority data supports idea saturated fat increases risk cardiovascular disease support sources1 harvard university school public health published easy guide fats cholesterolhere recommend decrease fat intake overall replace saturated fats unsaturated less saturated better2 convincing paper subject says thisbased consistent evidence human studies replacing saturated fat polyunsaturated fat modestly lowers coronary heart disease risk 10 risk reduction 5 energy substitution whereas replacing saturated fat carbohydrate benefit replacing saturated fat monounsaturated fat uncertain effects restate replace saturated fat polysaturated fat reduce risk heard disease authors say 10 risk reduction modest consider likely die heart attack 10 risk reduction quite welcome opinionfurther research shown metaanalysis trials showed increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption replacement saturated fat reduced risk coronary heart disease events 19 huge effectcitation herelipids 2010 oct4510893905 epub 2010 mar 31saturated fat cardiometabolic risk factors coronary heart disease stroke diabetes fresh look evidencemicha r mozaffarian ddepartment epidemiology harvard school public health boston 02115 usa3 finally list studies done subject find topic controversial 5050 tossup majority studies find saturated fat increase risk cardiovascular diseaseto summarize learned conversations articles know proof medium chain saturated fats behave differently long chain saturated fats know saturated fats likely increase risk cardiovascular disease much 19i decided take conservative path sold coconut oil bought hopefully someone plans using way besides eating hope realize health benefits associated replacing saturated fats diet polyunsaturated fats,negative,2012-01

They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.  Purchased from Swanson, my favorite purveyor of health products, this coconut oil is one of the highest qualities of life healing offerings available from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of the jar on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust this company [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG"">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray</a>.  From reading Bruce Fife's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS"">The Coconut Oil Miracle</a> I clarified my belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil and in this brand's production purity.  My experience of using this product for only 24 hours had shown results which have made me feel blessed... finally!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then ultimately seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4"">The Magnesium Miracle</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, can work as magnesium's ultimate catalyst.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my reviews on magnesium products along with the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great books and products of Magnesium and Coconut are available on Amazon, found easily using the search capacity.<br /><br />According to experts, the most important thing to know about oils and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed clearly in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods and additives defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than Mg, and in current food market and habits is usually supplied in quantities much too large, causing many illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This is clearly detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons severely deficient in magnesium [like I am] is that in its current state that fruit holds more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.  In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.  Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient. With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some books say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary foods, in order to live strong and disease free.

Since then, two relatives came down with scabies. They went the chemical route via their doctor. I never did. As I researched this I think one of the reasons coconut oil works for me is that the oil smothers the little critters. Instead of chemically killing them, I am drowning them in coconut oil. Plus so what if the oil gets into my blood stream! My rashes healed, my skin is soft. Now the scabies take a while to leave your body, but I just kept a small container of coconut oil and if I feel an itch, I apply it there. I also read that if you put TEA TREE Oil or Clove oil ( a few drops) and use coconut oil as a carrier it may really kill scabies. So I am using a bit of Tea Tree Oil just in case, but I feel I was being cured just by using the coconut oil.<br />I gave it four stars because of the plastic container.

The consistency is translucent sorta clunky white, sorta like grated candle would look. Just like butter, it immediately melts in your hand or mouth, to say nothing of the frying pan. Smells great, tastes also nice: like, well, coconut. Supposedly it's great for cooking due to its supposedly higher heat-resistance something: it's supposed to keep its nutritional qualities when heated better than other common cooking oils. There's a rub though: with many foods you can mix and match and achieve some sort of mixed flavour -- not with this stuff! It's irrepressible: whatever you add it to -- veggies, cakes, meat, cardboard, or motor oil -- will then smell/taste like coconut and nothing beside. It overpowers every other flavour. So the only cooking variables you have left when using it is texture and sweetness (and looks, I guess). It goes very well with something that's sweet (probably because we're used to coconut being used in sweets). From what I've tried, it goes well with carrots, apples, sunflower seeds (anything nutty-tasting), stuff like that. Real good with sweet potatoes. But I would not recommed using it for cooking meat (unless you like your pork chops smelling and tasting like coconut). You can't kill this flavour, that's what I'm getting at. I'm using it carefully (not too much and in suitable combinations) and I'm happy with it so far. The product seems good, and so is the price (Added on 12/18/2010: that was the price at the time of purchase, $13.54 on Dec 2, 2010 -- and now, only two weeks later, the price on this page is $18.46, amazing, no? A 30% increase in two weeks, wow, these guys sure are optimistic about the value of their product).<br /><br />A bit of a warning: there's a megaton of unsubstantiated semi-literate BS online about miraculous powers of coconut oil. Be careful about it: coconut oil is pure saturated fat (a serving consists of 14 grams of fat, 13 of them saturated) -- and I've found no acceptable medical/scientific info in support of the healthfulness of saturated fat (while there's a lot on the opposite). What I did find was that it's not openly harmful when used in small doses: a healthy 200-lbs 40-sh male, not overweight and exercising regularly, is allowed 200 saturated-fat calories a day. A serving of coconut oil is 130 calories, but of course, you'll get saturated fats from other foods too. Another thing is that coconut oil contains no appreciable amounts of vitamins/minerals (unlike butter, which is _loaded_ with all kinds of goodies). So be careful: despite the squall of shilling on the net and in print, it's not health food. But it's tasty and not like lethally bad, so...<br />-------<br />Added on 12/18/2010: I'm half-way through the first jar, and I find myself using it less and less. It's too smelly, and I just don't have that much opportunity to use it for stuff where it's OK. Besides being food, it is supposedly also good for external use, for skin and hair; I haven't tried it this way (yet; maybe I will). But I have a feeling that _as food_ it doesn't have much of a future in this household: it's too overpowering, too particular.<br />-----<br />01/01/2011: Tried it for skin lotion: well, um, yes and no. No: it doesn't get absorbed into the skin, and the area of application stays greasy forever, so you can't do it before going out (even wiping with, say, paper towel, doesn't remove enough of it, so you'll stain the clothes with oil). Yes: it has a terrific staying power, hours and several hand washes after application there's still something remaining on the skin. And I work with my hands a lot, with the result that they tend to get real dirty, so I wash hands frequently and rather severely, the surgical way: very hot water, several soap-ups, brush. This causes severe dehydration of the skin, so I've always used hand lotion immediately after, but with coconut oil the skin remains slightly oiled, soft and moisturised even after a couple of such washes.<br /><br />So, finally: I'm not sure how (and whether) I'll continue to use coconut oil: I have definitely ceased to use it as food; as moisturiser we'll see... at least it's marginally cheaper than dry-skin cream so I'll give it a longer try. But the cream dries up in a minute, so it's more practicable, I must say. Doesn't smell of coconut either! :-) I must say I did not find the product as useful as it's hyped, so I'm taking one star off right now. I'll revisit in a month or two: if I discover by then that I've stopped using this thing altogether, I'll update the review to this effect.<br />--------<br />02/20/2011: Bottom line: I think I've settled into a two-sided routine with this oil: I use it, first, for light-frying/sauteing veggies (with yams or sweet potatoes as a basis; adding greens, like spinach, in the mix later on). I don't do this often though, 'cause I prefer to steam or eat raw, rather than fry anything; sauteing is quicker though, so when I'm pressed for time, this is workable. The other use is for skin: skin really loves this oil -- in addition to staying hydrated forever, it becomes very even in texture and colour; after shower I grease myself up, literally from head to toe, and it's just lovely (except for the clothes who get stained :-).",gAAAAABoh1-95sUKzM1UsQj5SKg91jMYtuOxXNM_HTcJ8GglYhQe9pRsPtG0Q-O_hNVuHcrBky71bezL1LI0Humrks3TofQewg==,Ghost(Ghost(M)),first im sure called oil butter oil solid wo refrigeration consistency translucent sorta clunky white sorta like grated candle would look like butter immediately melts hand mouth say nothing frying pan smells great tastes also nice like well coconut supposedly great cooking due supposedly higher heatresistance something supposed keep nutritional qualities heated better common cooking oils theres rub though many foods mix match achieve sort mixed flavour stuff irrepressible whatever add veggies cakes meat cardboard motor oil smelltaste like coconut nothing beside overpowers every flavour cooking variables left using texture sweetness looks guess goes well something thats sweet probably used coconut used sweets ive tried goes well carrots apples sunflower seeds anything nuttytasting stuff like real good sweet potatoes would recommed using cooking meat unless like pork chops smelling tasting like coconut cant kill flavour thats im getting im using carefully much suitable combinations im happy far product seems good price added 12182010 price time purchase 1354 dec 2 2010 two weeks later price page 1846 amazing 30 increase two weeks wow guys sure optimistic value producta bit warning theres megaton unsubstantiated semiliterate bs online miraculous powers coconut oil careful coconut oil pure saturated fat serving consists 14 grams fat 13 saturated ive found acceptable medicalscientific info support healthfulness saturated fat theres lot opposite find openly harmful used small doses healthy 200lbs 40sh male overweight exercising regularly allowed 200 saturatedfat calories day serving coconut oil 130 calories course youll get saturated fats foods another thing coconut oil contains appreciable amounts vitaminsminerals unlike butter _loaded_ kinds goodies careful despite squall shilling net print health food tasty like lethally bad soadded 12182010 im halfway first jar find using less less smelly dont much opportunity use stuff ok besides food supposedly also good external use skin hair havent tried way yet maybe feeling _as food_ doesnt much future household overpowering particular01012011 tried skin lotion well um yes doesnt get absorbed skin area application stays greasy forever cant going even wiping say paper towel doesnt remove enough youll stain clothes oil yes terrific staying power hours several hand washes application theres still something remaining skin work hands lot result tend get real dirty wash hands frequently rather severely surgical way hot water several soapups brush causes severe dehydration skin ive always used hand lotion immediately coconut oil skin remains slightly oiled soft moisturised even couple washesso finally im sure whether ill continue use coconut oil definitely ceased use food moisturiser well see least marginally cheaper dryskin cream ill give longer try cream dries minute practicable must say doesnt smell coconut either must say find product useful hyped im taking one star right ill revisit month two discover ive stopped using thing altogether ill update review effect02202011 bottom line think ive settled twosided routine oil use first lightfryingsauteing veggies yams sweet potatoes basis adding greens like spinach mix later dont often though cause prefer steam eat raw rather fry anything sauteing quicker though im pressed time workable use skin skin really loves oil addition staying hydrated forever becomes even texture colour shower grease literally head toe lovely except clothes get stained,positive,2010-12

My skin doesn't tan or burn easily, and I am obsessed with anti-aging (I want to write a book on what worked and what didn't when I am older :D). I live in California, so the weather is rather neutral year-round.<br /><br />*What coconut oil has done for me:<br /><br />Coconut oil smells sooo nice and has a great texture -- depending on the weather it is either creamy and solid or silky and liquid. Being as affordable as it is, I can smear this all-over my body after showers and it will absorb within 30 minutes to an hour. My skin feels sooo soft and hydrated afterwards and it even helps my sunless tanners last longer! This stuff made my skin so soft that one day I wore cotton shorts from Hollister (so you can imagine, slightly baggy). It was a hot day, and after walking around outside for only around 45 minutes my upper thighs/bikini line were KILLING ME.

Just leave it in overnight and wash out the next day and my hair is so shiny and soft afterwards and even feels a bit thicker.  It is great for your skin, especially if you feel like you are getting sick.  Just slather it on and let its amazing healing properties absorb into your blood stream via your skin.  I use it in smoothies to help my immune system as well.  And if I feel like I am coming down with something I will mix it with orange juice like is recommended in the Coconut Oil Miracle book.<br /><br />I also oil pull with it.

Barlean's was the most expensive of the three but for the flavor worth it. Nutiva was a close second in taste & smell and is more economical. Tropical Traditional (which I have always loved their products in the past) did not measure up in flavor. In fact it had a strange, burnt taste and smell...something was off about it. If you want no coconut flavor at all, get the expeller pressed coconut oil. It is less expensive than virgin coconut oil...all three companies use proper, healthy, non-chemical practices to extract the oil, so I would go with the best buy for the expeller cold pressed oil but pay a little more for the flavored version.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZ8D0"">Barlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jar</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVVJ6W"">32-oz glass - Gold Label Organic Virgin Coconut Oil - 1 quart</a>",gAAAAABoh1-9cxSBSXTwzf2a6XBaRcfZ-Qj9N6hHK_OnH24FTjO2zmLa6aD_NIIw83TMOGrlQTvKmvxEbpCp_t-biQUtOsT-qQ==,Sheri Glavan,tried three different brands coconut oil barleans nutiva tropical traditions virgin coconut oil nice light coconut flavor expeller pressed coconut oil flavor buying virgin coconut oil heres tip barleans best flavor smelli wanted eat right jar smelled good tasted phenomenal barleans expensive three flavor worth nutiva close second taste smell economical tropical traditional always loved products past measure flavor fact strange burnt taste smellsomething want coconut flavor get expeller pressed coconut oil less expensive virgin coconut oilall three companies use proper healthy nonchemical practices extract oil would go best buy expeller cold pressed oil pay little flavored versionbarleans organic oils extra virgin coconut oil 16ounce jarnutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil 15ounce tubs pack 232oz glass gold label organic virgin coconut oil 1 quart,positive,2011-10

It came hard as a rock, yellow-looking and smelled pretty foul (almost sickly-sweet) - certainly nothing like coconut. I literally was chipping it out of the jar, and melting it was near impossible. Eventually, I realized that I was dealing with rancid oil, so it's pretty fortunate that I didn't use it all that often. Yuck.<br /><br />After watching a view Youtube videos for hair care, I noticed everyone's was white, creamy and you could easily scoop it out of the jar, so I decided to give it another shot and purchased Nutiva in February 2011. I'm so glad I did, too, because this stuff is great and for a number of things, some of which caught me off guard.<br /><br />- Cooking -<br />I enjoy cooking with it now and then, especially with my quick-fix quesadillas when I don't have time to cook anything else. However, it doesn't work on everything due to the subtle yet nutty flavor it can give, but I do like it for frying. Your place will smell like coconut when you fry with it, as a warning. I do love how fast it heats up, though.<br /><br />- Hair -<br />I originally intended to use this for hair and as a deep conditioning mask. I am biracial, with 3A/3b and a tinge of 3C hair. While I usually prefer to have it relaxed, I decided to give it a break due to lack of funds. The hard water we have here has been wreaking havoc on my hair and it's been in need of a trim for a while, but this stuff has greatly improved things, and it even can be used (lightly) to help tame frizz to some degree as a leave-in. My ringlets are back and the best-looking they've been since I can remember, and all I've been using since then is just Aphogee Green Tea spray, coconut oil and occasional argan oil.<br /><br />- Skin -<br />I consistently use this on my body and at night as skin cream. For the face, you only need a tiny, tiny amount. It also helps to tame down blemishes, which is a bonus, and leaves skin glowy. Last year or the year before, I also developed what looked like flesh-colored moles, which I thought were blemishes at first, but I can't be certain. Nothing I did would get rid of them though, until I started using the oil, which I found odd, but at least it worked! All in all, my skin has dramatically improved using this, with the help of some other products, and I don't feel I have to wear foundation.<br /><br />- Pets -<br />I give 1/2 tbls. to my cats and 1 tbls. to my dog a few times a week to help maintain their coats and keep their skin nice. It seems to be doing great and they've stopped driving me mental with scratching. I also tried it in hopes of helping my dog with her seizures. While it's not a drastic improvement, they have been fewer in between, which may or may not have a connection. I just mix it in their food maybe 2-3 days a week (ask your vet about how often, especially if they have health problems), and they love it. Even my female cat, who's picky about what she'll eat licks at the oil before she munches away.<br /><br />- Warts -<br />Short of the suspicious-looking things on my face at one point, I don't get moles, warts, or even freckles. However, I did get one whopping wart on the top of my big toe last year, which nothing would get rid of. I tried apple cider vinegar, wart patches and gels - you name it; I tried it. Not only did it hurt like crazy and work slowly, but it never got rid of it. All I did get was a scar and a lot of grief, only for it to return a few weeks later.<br /><br />When I started using coconut oil on the skin, I realized one day, like with my face, that my wart that had grown back was getting smaller. I kept watching it and finally realized the connection. I started using bandaids and applied a glob of oil on the spot before bed and then really started noticing results. This wart was the size of a chick pea (sorry to be gross lol), but now you can't see anything.<br /><br />I finally looked things up and realized that it was the acid in the oil that attacks lipid-coated virus cells, such as what's associated with HPV (warts), so I guess it makes sense. I was surprised though! I can tell due to the texture of the skin that it's not 100% gone (roots), but it still getting better and I'm not embarrassed anymore. It took about a month, but the more painful options took just as long and this is pain-free. So, it's something to try!<br /><br />Love this stuff and can't stop raving about it. I'm going to purchase more soon in this size to keep one in my kitchen and one in my bathroom again, plus a larger one for the mutts. The bathroom one still has plenty in it, despite me using it near-daily.",gAAAAABoh1-9FlwqeGCKPp3Sn9YgEF9b1SoZbivPBZAMFvbkdmuo-VFzs-rHlfelemEojRl6g4u88xzVOFQdKjsKlXm_fUeyxQ==,LazyChick,almost put using coconut oil entirely purchasing another brand think different packaging came hard rock yellowlooking smelled pretty foul almost sicklysweet certainly nothing like coconut literally chipping jar melting near impossible eventually realized dealing rancid oil pretty fortunate didnt use often yuckafter watching view youtube videos hair care noticed everyones white creamy could easily scoop jar decided give another shot purchased nutiva february 2011 im glad stuff great number things caught guard cooking enjoy cooking especially quickfix quesadillas dont time cook anything else however doesnt work everything due subtle yet nutty flavor give like frying place smell like coconut fry warning love fast heats though hair originally intended use hair deep conditioning mask biracial 3a3b tinge 3c hair usually prefer relaxed decided give break due lack funds hard water wreaking havoc hair need trim stuff greatly improved things even used lightly help tame frizz degree leavein ringlets back bestlooking theyve since remember ive using since aphogee green tea spray coconut oil occasional argan oil skin consistently use body night skin cream face need tiny tiny amount also helps tame blemishes bonus leaves skin glowy last year year also developed looked like fleshcolored moles thought blemishes first cant certain nothing would get rid though started using oil found odd least worked skin dramatically improved using help products dont feel wear foundation pets give 12 tbls cats 1 tbls dog times week help maintain coats keep skin nice seems great theyve stopped driving mental scratching also tried hopes helping dog seizures drastic improvement fewer may may connection mix food maybe 23 days week ask vet often especially health problems love even female cat whos picky shell eat licks oil munches away warts short suspiciouslooking things face one point dont get moles warts even freckles however get one whopping wart top big toe last year nothing would get rid tried apple cider vinegar wart patches gels name tried hurt like crazy work slowly never got rid get scar lot grief return weeks laterwhen started using coconut oil skin realized one day like face wart grown back getting smaller kept watching finally realized connection started using bandaids applied glob oil spot bed really started noticing results wart size chick pea sorry gross lol cant see anythingi finally looked things realized acid oil attacks lipidcoated virus cells whats associated hpv warts guess makes sense surprised though tell due texture skin 100 gone roots still getting better im embarrassed anymore took month painful options took long painfree something trylove stuff cant stop raving im going purchase soon size keep one kitchen one bathroom plus larger one mutts bathroom one still plenty despite using neardaily,positive,2011-04

A little oil leaked out of the plastic bags into the box, but they were the only things packed in the box so nothing was ruined. I can see that if the lids had been any looser though, there would have been a mess.

Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.

She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.

I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.

The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.

She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily.

In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding.

As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.

The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.

I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.

If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.  K-cups for the Keurig makes it instant - and with this Vanilla Cappuccino - its ready right away - no need to add another thing.  AND - this is the ONLY place we've found that carries this product.  I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.  This is the 3rd time I've placed an order for these and the price was the best ever - $8.47 I think - for 24.  Great price!  Usually they are are betwween $10.47 and $12.

I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors).

I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts.

A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.",gAAAAABoh1-9lI2DplFLpmslEJkVEhzFitGlVepsDw4nq89cgO0XYqdiP49UhsHhpXiZ8mn6m131GDldVjs0OpwAmUUXMyZyHIZRyQ1uzHH6in3_Cc4aIas=,"David Pearlman ""sound fanatic""",eternal dieters quest replacement oily fatty ohsoaddictive real potato chips sure get baked versions lack bit crunch flavor categories cost lotso quest continues got case popchips cheddar flavor amazon inspired good sale thoughts must something betterthe first thing noticed calorie count substantial 3oz bag chips lunch bag 1oz 360 calories 120 calories per serving 35 fat calories better numbers tradition potato chips run around 160 calories 1oz serving get 8090 calories fat calorie counts vary dramatically upward depending chips numbers typical betterand calories dont tell whole storya 1 oz serving feels larger popchips puffed largerbut dont let word puff scare major non puffy tasting solid crunch flavor also pretty good best part look orange crap hands thats big plus cheddar flavored chiptake cheetosi liked cheddar ones much ordered bbq ones well theyre even better tasting imhoone thing note lower fat lower calories low sodium 1oz portion 290mg sodium 12 recommended daily intake normal person salt restricted diet dont like salt think twiceon whole good tasty importantly satisfying time less caloric much less fatty standard potato chips saltier many would prefer presuming salt restricted diet theyll ok bonus supposed natural personally dont care last point certainly bad thingone last thing find diets claim calories source calories hogwash calories chip diet worthy big quantities consider calories total caloric intake make personal decision whether make sensetry yourselfamazon offers sampler package multiple varieties might best way sample,positive,2010-08

I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor.

Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far.

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M.

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

At first, I didn't understand ""Popchips"", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.

Texture-wise, they remind me of ""Munchos"" only lighter and without the oily feel and taste.  Remember Munchos?  These are WAY better.<br /><br />Next thing - the flavor from the sweet potatos is YUMMY!  I know when I first read ""rice flour"" in the ingredients, I was thinking those cardboard-like rice cakes.  The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw ""0.8 ounce"", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!  Not that 0.8 is a big bag, or ""filling"" or anything like that, but the bag is just the right size, which is a very pleasant surpise to me!

They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that.

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry.

I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.

I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.

They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.

But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp.

When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG.

Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.
